This api is for forum websites. Such as ekÅŸi sÃ¶zlÃ¼k and stack overflow.

If we want to explain it simply: Users can ask questions, give answers to these questions. They may like the questions and answers.

Of course, some features can be added. For example, categories can be created for questions. Maybe I can add it soon.

I am currently creating a frontend for this api.
